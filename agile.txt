User Story 1:
As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to 
have access to a cheat sheet that maps git commands to GiggleGit.

User Story 2:
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to 
monitor their progress through the onboarding process.

User Story 3:
As a new user, I want to understand how merges are managed using memes.
    Task: Create a tutorial to learn GiggleGit's meme based merge resolution system
        
        Ticket 1: Create a step by step guide for resolving merge conflicts with memes
            The guide should cover top to bottom from merge commands, how and why, interface, best practices 
        
        Ticket 2: A walkthrough resolving conflicts using merge
            Walk the user through creating a repository with intentional conflicts 
            then using the meme based system to resolve the conflict step by step 

This is not a user story because it lacks a clear goal tied to the user's experience.
It is a functional requirement.
